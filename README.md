# OCaml-CI

[![OCaml-CI Build Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fci.ocamllabs.io%2Fbadge%2Focurrent%2Focaml-ci%2Fmaster&logo=ocaml)](https://ci.ocamllabs.io/github/ocurrent/ocaml-ci)

This is an [OCurrent][] pipeline that provides CI for OCaml projects hosted on GitHub.
It uses metadata from the projectâ€™s opam and dune files to work out what to build,
and uses caching to make builds fast. It automatically tests projects against
multiple OCaml versions and OS platforms.

The pipeline is defined in [pipeline.ml][]. It:

1. Gets the list of installations of its GitHub app.
2. For each installation, gets the list of repositories to check.
3. For each repository, gets the branches and PRs to check.
4. For each target, it fetches the head commit, generates a Dockerfile and builds it.

The generated Dockerfile first adds all the `*.opam` files found in the project,
then uses `opam` to install all the dependencies, then adds the rest of the source
files. This means that rebuilds are often very fast, because Docker will reuse the
previously cached build step as long as the opam files don't change.

To add the CI to your own project:

1. Go to https://github.com/apps/ocaml-ci and install the app for your GitHub user.
2. Configure just the repositories you want to test (start with one!). If you select `All Repositories` we won't build anything.
3. Ask us to add you to the alpha-testers list by submitting a PR against this
   repository adding yourself to `--github-account-allowlist` in `stack.yml`. eg https://github.com/ocurrent/ocaml-ci/pull/346
4. Report bugs :-)

## Installation

Get the code with:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ocurrent/ocaml-ci.git
```

Note: you need to clone with `--recursive` because this project uses submodules
(it depends on some packages that aren't released yet).
If you forget, `git submodule update --init` will fetch them.

To test the CI on a local Git clone, use:

```sh
dune exec -- ocaml-ci-local /path/to/project
```

This will build the project as the real CI would,
but it only monitors the default branch and does not push the results anywhere.
It runs a web interface at <http://localhost:8080>.
This is useful if you want to try out changes to the pipeline.

If you want to build the whole system, the easiest way is using Docker:

```sh
docker build -t ocaml-ci-service .
docker build -f Dockerfile.web -t ocaml-ci-web .
```

The `stack.yml` contains the configuration used on the live system.
You'll have to register your own GitHub app to be able to test the services locally.

If you want it to update to changes in opam-repository automatically you'll also need
to register a webhook there sending push events to the CI's `/webhooks/github` path.

## Remote API

The service provides a [Cap'n Proto endpoint][capnp-api] and a command-line client that uses it.
You will need to be given the `ocaml-ci.cap` file, which grants access to the API.
The client can be built and run using `dune exec -- ocaml-ci --ci-cap=ocaml-ci.cap ...`, or
installed as `ocaml-ci`.

To see the branches and PRs that ocaml-ci is monitoring in a repository:

```bash
$ ocaml-ci mirage/irmin

2e838b491a4c0b21750f7a2e6dee88eee1c7d94e refs/pull/867/head
```

You can pass either the reference (e.g. `refs/heads/master`) or the commit hash to choose one of them.

```bash
$ ocaml-ci mirage/irmin refs/heads/master
alpine-3.10-ocaml-4.08
```

To view the log (following it if incomplete):

```bash
$ ocaml-ci mirage/irmin refs/heads/master alpine-3.10-ocaml-4.08 log
[...]
- Test Successful in 17.643s. 99 tests run.

```

Instead of `log`, you can also use `cancel`, `rebuild` or `status`.

For convenience, you can omit the leading `refs/` when specifying a reference,
and for PRs you can omit the trailing `/head`. For commits, you must give at
least the first 6 characters. e.g.

```bash
$ ocaml-ci mirage/irmin pull/867 alpine-3.10-ocaml-4.08 cancel
```

## Deployment

`ocaml-ci` is deployed as two docker images built from `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.web`, with 
the live service following `live-engine` for the backend and `live-www` for the frontend.
An ocurrent-deployer [pipeline](deploy.ci3.ocamllabs.io) watches these branches, performing a docker build 
and deploy whenever it sees a new commit. The live branches should typically contain commits from `master` plus potentially 
short lived commits for testing changes that are later merged into `master`.

To deploy code changes either from `master` or a branch:
 * check that you've rebased the changes onto master
 * git push -u upstream HEAD:live-engine or
 * git push -u upstream HEAD:live-www 

To deploy changes to `stack.yml` run (assuming a docker context with sufficient access):

``` bash
docker -c ci.ocamllabs.io stack deploy -c stack.yml ocaml-ci
```
## Local development

See [this document](doc/dev.md) for set up and running the server and web components locally.

## TODO 

 * combine pipeline steps to share as much logic as possible
 * extract Index.Owner_set, Repo_set and Ref_map into database tables

 * split up web-ui into routes / rendering / backend+rpc
 * boundaries for ocaml-ci persistence layer, caqti?

 * port web-ui to dream?
